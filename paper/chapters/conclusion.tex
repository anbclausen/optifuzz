We have a lot of ideas for future work that we did not get around to. These include:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.6em}
    \item Extend OptiFuzz to generate more complicated programs, eg. by reintroducing the division and modulus operators while dealing with division by zero in a meaningful way.
    \item Implement other relevant input classes. Perhaps a dynamic class containing the hardcoded values from a program. This might be able to catch the very specific but unpredictable values that cause branching.
    \item Extend the statistical analysis and consider results from all input classes. This could include researching the usability of other t-tests.
    \item Create a tool that warns developers in real-time about constant C expressions that might be compiled to variable time by comparing it to a database precomputed using OptiFuzz. This tool could furthermore be implemented in a CI/CD environment.
    \item Extend OptiFuzz to support other processor architecture, especially including ones used by embedded systems.
\end{itemize}
