We have provided a tool, OptiFuzz, that can be used to test compilers for timing vulnerabilities.
OptiFuzz has been optimized considering the C language specification, the x86-64 architecture, and state-of-the-art statistical analysis.
This has resulted in a simple tool that is indicative of the real-world issue of timing vulnerabilities introduced by compilers.
With OptiFuzz, we have shown that between 0.15\% and 12.63\% of randomly generated programs are vulnerable to timing attacks when compiled with \texttt{gcc} using various optimization flags.
We have used our results to pinpoint specific optimizations within \texttt{gcc} that are responsible for introducing timing vulnerabilities, as well as specific expression patterns that are vulnerable to resulting in timing vulnerabilities when compiled.
We have also shown that due to better utilization of \texttt{cmovcc} instructions, \texttt{clang} introduces significantly fewer timing vulnerabilities -- so much that we could not detect any timing vulnerabilities introduced by \texttt{clang} using our methodology.
In light of this result, we have discussed how the issue of timing vulnerabilities introduced by compilers can be mitigated by using language-based security techniques from the literature.
Generally, solutions to this problem represent a trade-off between security and performance where very secure solutions are not that performant and vice versa.

In the light of our research, we have identified several areas for future work. $\ldots$
